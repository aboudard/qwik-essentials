# Chapter 2 - Getting started : Install dependencies and create the project

You have as we write this tutorial, two ways to create a new project with Qwik :

- Using npm create command
- Using Nx and the qwik-nx plugin

## Using npm create command

The easiest way to create a new project is to use the npm create command. This command will create a new project with the latest version of Qwik and all the dependencies needed to run it.

```bash
npm create qwik@latest
```

## Using Nx and the qwik-nx plugin

If you are using Nx, you can use the qwik-nx plugin to create a new project.
This plugin will create a new Nx workspace with the latest version of Qwik and all the dependencies needed to run it.
You can find the project here : https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-nx

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace@latest my-workspace --preset=qwik-nx
```

## Run the application

Depending on your install, you have the following options

<Tabs
  defaultValue="create"
  values={[
    { label: "With npm create", value: "create" },
    { label: "With Qwik Nx", value: "nx" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="create">
    ```bash
      npm run start
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nx">
  The commands are handled by Nx, and can be found in the `apps/my-app/project.json` file.
    ```bash
      nx run my-app:serve
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
