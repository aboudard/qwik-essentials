# Chapter 2 - Getting started : Install dependencies and create the project

You have as we write this tutorial, two ways to create a new project with Qwik :
- Using npm create command
- Using Nx and the qwik-nx plugin

## Using npm create command

The easiest way to create a new project is to use the npm create command. This command will create a new project with the latest version of Qwik and all the dependencies needed to run it.

```bash
npm create qwik@latest
```

## Using Nx and the qwik-nx plugin

If you are using Nx, you can use the qwik-nx plugin to create a new project. 
This plugin will create a new Nx workspace with the latest version of Qwik and all the dependencies needed to run it.
You can find the project here : https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-nx

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace@latest my-workspace --preset=qwik-nx
```
